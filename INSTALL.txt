Drop these files into your repo ROOT (same place as index.html):
- firebase.js
- people.html
- 404.html

Then commit + push.

Also change the People button in your nav (index.html etc) to:
  href="people.html"

This pack fixes:
- People search error: FirebaseError: Expected first argument to collection()...
- Public search + profiles work even when NOT logged in (uses only the `usernames` collection, which your rules allow to read).
